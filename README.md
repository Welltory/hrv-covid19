# COVID-19 and Wearables Open Data Research

We all share a concern about the rapid spread of COVID-19 around our planet. At this point, it’s unclear whether researchers will be able to come up with a vaccine or if many of us should prepare to build immunity by catching the disease and getting over it. In either scenario, we find it important to study how heart rate variability (HRV) can be used to monitor COVID-19 and help determine a healthy individual’s ability to cope with the virus.

For this reason, we are launching an open research project aimed at identifying diagnostic patterns of coronavirus-inflicted disease progression. 

Research participants diagnosed with COVID-19 will provide HRV readings from their phones using PPG measurement technology. This research will, therefore, be done both remotely (crucial today) and globally, as we have over 1.5 million people using our app all over the world.

Welltory will provide open data access to all qualified researchers. This data will include heart rate variability (HRV) measurements collected from COVID-19 participants via the Welltory app, and also data collected from supported gadgets, including Apple Watch, Fitbit, Garmin, and others that have integrations with Google Fit or Apple Health.

# Research objective

![Welltory Research objective](https://i.imgur.com/LZtUXuu.jpg)

We are dedicated to helping people improve their health and boost their immune systems. We believe that heart rate variability monitoring is one of the most powerful tools available to achieve better health. This is why we created a platform that makes sense of people’s health and fitness data and enriches it with heart rate variability measurements that our users take with their smartphones.

We’re announcing open data collection from people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or suspect they have it. The aim is to gather data from participants' devices all over the world. One of the key advantages of our approach is that participants collect their health measurements remotely, without placing an additional burden on the overwhelmed healthcare system. We believe in preventive, personalized care and are offering people the chance to contribute their data to science. The project is therefore structured to get consent from at least 1,000 people and make the data available to everyone qualified and willing to do research.

The purpose is to gather data on heart rate variability, heart rate, and other data collected from the Welltory app and wearables such as Garmin, Apple Watch, or Fitbit. Researchers can then study if specific data patterns could be used to predict symptoms of illness, particularly those that characterize viruses such as COVID-19.

We would also like to stress the open nature of this project. Anybody with an idea or hypothesis they’d like to test is welcome to participate if they have the relevant expertise.

# Data overview

We collect:
1. Heart rate variability measurements. They can be taken with any Bluetooth-enabled heart rate monitor or with a smartphone camera that has a reasonably high resolution.

2. Data from user-connected gadgets including Apple Watch, Fitbit and others that have integrations with Google Fit or Apple Health.
3. Clinically validated physical and mental health assessments. A special assessment will be created specifically for this project, where people will add information about symptoms and test results.
4. In the event the research community so requires, we can swiftly set up data collection from almost any app or gadget through our IFTTT integration: https://ifttt.com/welltory

**Here is a list of [supported data types datatypes](https://github.com/Welltory/hrv-covid19/blob/master/datatypes)**

We hold heart rate variability measurements to be the single most important data type out of those listed above since it's a biomarker that can be tracked by anyone with a phone. It is also one of the most well-researched biomarkers, with over 25,000 [publications on Pubmed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Heart+rate+variability).

A lot of research confirms the connection between HRV and stress, fitness, chronic illnesses, and so on.

HRV is a reliable tool for identifying illness because an illness is a stress that the body has trouble coping with. Low heart rate variability correlates with a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system (SNS) – a response that is associated with Th2 dominance in the immune system, which translates into a reduced ability to fight pathogens.

# Hypotheses worth testing

![Hypotheses worth testing](https://i.imgur.com/L3WAWBA.jpg)

These are some ways HRV can benefit people dealing with our world’s new challenges.

### Preventive measures

Quarantined or non-infected people can keep their immune systems in good condition by following the recommendations that come with their HRV measurements. Our hypothesis is that those who were in good shape in the first place will cope with the disease better. 

Many people also need regular reassurance that they’re alright. Currently, their only option is to get tested at hospitals, which are already overwhelmed and where the risk of contagion is high. We believe that having a biomarker that can tell a person “you are fine” would make a difference. 

In the [Alternative At-Home Test For Coronavirus: Heart Rate Variability](https://medium.com/@welltory/326a7237abe7) blog post we speak in detail about how heart rate variability can be interpreted during the course of illness.

### Early diagnosis

If you haven’t tested positive and you know your baseline HRV scores, an abrupt decline in variability can signal you’re sick before common symptoms like a dry cough, fever or shortness of breath kick in. We’ve observed this effect many times in user data, and it can be vital from the perspective of timely self-isolation and reducing infection rates.

We also believe that data from common wearables and fitness trackers also can show up a pattern that will signal health risks, including SDNN and resting heart rate from Apple Watch, SPO2 from Garmin, as well as daily data on sleep, steps, workouts, etc.

### Response to treatment

There are many attempts to develop treatments, and HRV measurement and heart rate data can be used to identify how an individual is responding to treatment before there is a change in observable symptoms. 

### Signs of recovery

Heart rate variability is a good metric to track recovery and signs the body has begun to cope with the illness. We consider this important both for those who have to recover at home and people in the hospitals.
There is some evidence that resting heart rate, average heart rate, and blood pressure readings can also be helpful to monitor changes.

# How it works

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms completes an [application form](https://welltory.typeform.com/to/ah8rnl), installs the app, and starts collecting data. There is also a research [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/229474431507315/) for participants.

We are regularly uploading the data in **CSV format** here on Github

Researches have access to HRV and wearables data of COVID-19-positive individuals who have agreed to the [consent form for research participants](https://github.com/Welltory/hrv-covid19/blob/master/CONSENT). We created a Slack community for communication between researchers. To get join it, fill out [this form](https://welltory.typeform.com/to/FS4X7c).

# Why participate in the study

In short, the researchers may find that measuring heart rate variability helps:
1. Study the progression of illnesses before symptoms appear
2. Easily and remotely confirm that you’re not sick and do not need to be tested
3. Show if a person is responding to treatment
4. Track recovery
