## CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN AN OPEN SCIENCE RESEARCH STUDY
Study Title: Testing relationships between changes in physiological data collected through the Welltory App and other wearables and the onset of symptoms associated with viruses such as COVID-19. This study aims to identify relationships between COVID-19 symptoms and changes in heart rate variability, heart rate, and related metrics.

## WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?
This is an open research project aimed at identifying diagnostic patterns of coronavirus-inflicted disease progression. The purpose is to gather data on heart rate variability, heart rate, and other data collected from the Welltory app and wearables such as Garmin, Apple Watch, or Fitbit. Researchers can then study if specific data patterns could be used to predict symptoms of illness, particularly those that characterize viruses such as COVID-19.

## WHAT WILL I HAVE TO DO IF I TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?
We ask adult volunteers to: – Fill out a survey online – Download the Welltory app and sign up – Take daily heart rate variability measurements – Complete daily surveys to let us know if you’re experiencing symptoms – Share your data collected through the Welltory app (including heart rate variability, heart rate, sleep, and activity) with Welltory, Inc.

## WHAT’S THE DURATION OF THE STUDY?
We ask you to participate by taking heart rate variability measurements and completing surveys for about 2 months.

## CAN I WITHDRAW FROM THE STUDY?
Yes, you can stop as soon as you like. We ask that you message us to let us know if you’ve decided to withdraw. Researchers may also ask that you stop participating in the study if they believe this is in your best interest or suspect that you have not followed the rules.

Participating in this study may entail a loss of confidentiality and/or privacy if we are required by law to share your data, but we will keep your information confidential to the best of our ability. Your name and other personal information will never be used if the findings of this study are published or presented at scientific meetings or conferences.

## ARE THERE ANY BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY?
There are no direct benefits to participating in this research, but your data may help us develop an algorithm that health professionals can use to identify viruses such as COVID-19 in the earliest stages and take pre-emptive measures.

## WILL MY INFORMATION BE KEPT PRIVATE?
Your name and other personal information will never be used if the findings of this study are published or presented at scientific meetings or conferences. However, we cannot guarantee total privacy if we are ever required to share your information by law.
